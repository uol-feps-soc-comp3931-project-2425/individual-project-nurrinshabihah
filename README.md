# Formal Verificationof the Disjointness of Hamming Balls in Lean

This project formalises a key lemma in coding theory : **Disjointness of Hamming Balls**

## Getting started

To run this code:

- Open it directly using the Lean Web Editor (https://live.lean-lang.org/). No setup is required.

## Future work

- Formalisation of Hamming bound
- Partial implementation is in branch **hammingBound** [incomplete]
